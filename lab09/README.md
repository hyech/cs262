# CS 262 Monopoly Webservice

This is the data service I modified for Lab 9, and it is deployed here:
          
<https://fierce-refuge-58041.herokuapp.com/>

It is based on the standard Heroku with Node.js tutorial.

The database is relational with the schema specified in the `sql/` sub-directory,
 and is hosted on [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/).
